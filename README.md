NBA Player Season Totals taken off Basketball-Reference.com

Personal project to explore scraping and basic machine learning. Currently has all players' season total data from 1996 onwards till Feb 2021.

Big Question: Which players were all-stars?
Current assumption - taking full season stats instead of stats up till all-star break.
